About
------
**Jinwen Lin** is a four-year undergraduate student from [College of Optical Science and Engineering](http://opt.zju.edu.cn/opten/), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), China. 
Her main research interest includes nonlinear and ultrafast optics, fiber lasers and integrated photonic circuits. She is very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jianrong Qiu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=tuNTMvEAAAAJ) from Zhejiang University and [Associate. Prof. Kuen Yao Lau](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=WmQVUuAAAAAJ) from Soochow University.

Please find her CV here: [JinwenLin's CV](assets/CV_LinJinwen.pdf).

Besides, she has always dreamed of making the field of optical engineering as open and collaborative as the computer science community, fostering a strong open-source spirit and culture. To realize this vision, she decided to share the notes she took during her undergraduate studies on Zhihu, a popular knowledge-sharing platform in China. Through this, she hopes to connect with fellow students in the optics community to exchange ideas and share learning experiences. Currently, she has written several articles on this platform in Chinese, including
- [Use an article to simply build the basic framework of electromagnetic field and electromagnetic wave theory (Field and Wave Electromagnetics)](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/717862303)
- [Ansys Lumerical FDTD/Mode Simulation Tutorial and Case Study](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/1932427880786294738)
- [Optoelectronics (including laser principles/semiconductor physics/nonlinear) course notes](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/1958155720362001967)
- [Quantum Computation and Quantum Information——Knowledge Points Summary Mind Map](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/717720580)

Experience

- **Low-threshold Mode-locked Bismuth-doped Ultrafast Fiber Laser at O-band**  
  *Jan. 2023 -- May. 2025*  
  *Undergraduate Researcher | Supervisor: Prof. Jianrong Qiu and Assoc.Prof. Kuen Yao Lau | Zhejiang University*
  - Utilized bismuth-doped phosphosilicate glass fiber fabricated by the modified chemical vapour deposition method to generate high-quality emission for the optical communication O-band (~1260 nm to ~1360 nm).
  - Constructed a nonlinear-amplifying-loop-mirror mode-locked bismuth-doped fiber laser with a 3x3 optical coupler, which induced a phase shift of $$ \frac{2\pi}{3} $$.
  - Demonstrated that the initiation threshold of mode-locking in this novel structured laser cavity reduced at least by 45% and the output power increased at least 2 times, achieving improved mode-locking initiation capability and high-quality pulse emission compared to the conventional 2x2 coupler nonlinear-amplifying-loop-mirror laser cavity.
