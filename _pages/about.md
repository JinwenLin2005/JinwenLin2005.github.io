About
------
**Jinwen Lin** is a third-year undergraduate student from [College of Optical Science and Engineering](http://opt.zju.edu.cn/opten/), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). Her main research interest includes nonlinear and ultrafast optics, fiber lasers and integrated photonic quantum circuits.

She is very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jianrong Qiu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=tuNTMvEAAAAJ) from Zhejiang University and [Associate.Prof. Kuen Yao Lau](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=WmQVUuAAAAAJ) from Soochow University.
