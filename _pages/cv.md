Experience
======
- **Low-threshold Mode-locked Bismuth-doped Ultrafast Fiber Laser at O-band**  
  *Jan. 2023 -- Present*  
  *Undergraduate Researcher | Supervisor: Prof. Jianrong Qiu and Assoc.Prof. Kuen Yao Lau*

  - Utilized bismuth-doped phosphosilicate glass fiber fabricated by the modified chemical vapour deposition method to generate high-quality emission for the optical communication O-band (~1260 nm to ~1360 nm).
  - Constructed a nonlinear-amplifying-loop-mirror mode-locked bismuth-doped fiber laser with a 3x3 optical coupler, which induced a phase shift of $ \frac{2\pi}{3} $.
  - Demonstrated that the initiation threshold of mode-locking in this novel structured laser cavity reduced at least by 45% and the output power increased at least 2 times, achieving improved mode-locking initiation capability and high-quality pulse emission compared to the conventional 2x2 coupler nonlinear-amplifying-loop-mirror laser cavity.

- **Femtosecond Laser Direct-written of Waveguide and Quantum Circuit**  
  *Mar. 2024 -- Present*  
  *Undergraduate Researcher | Supervisor: Prof. Jianrong Qiu*

  - Developed a method for direct-written optical waveguides served as connectors between optical fibers and silicon-based chips through accelerated recombination in order to enable flexible control of mode field diameter and reduce losses.
  - Explored the method of direct-written three-dimensional optical waveguides using femtosecond laser to fabricate qubit logic gates and photonic quantum circuits.

  *Jan. 2025 -- Feb. 2025*  
  *Core Team Member | The American Mathematical/Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling*

  - Constructed three quantitative models for analyzing wear dynamics and traffic patterns on ancient staircases.
  - Predicted the age from the extent of wearing utilizing machine vision and COMSOL simulation.
